# Aeroponic System :seedling:
"Where we're going, we don't need soil" :shipit:

## Description
This project is my attempt to build a cheap alternative to the current options for at-home aeroponic systems that can cost upwards of $400.
That feels expensive, for a microcontroller, pump, and some plastic. I believe that the beauty in at-home farming is that it transfers the
power of affordable nutritious food from big businesses to the people who need it most.

## Current Iteration
It works! :tada:
